    <h1>Browned Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 1/4 cups all purpose baking flour</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon baking soda</ul>
    <ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>1 cup unsalted butter</ul>
    <ul>1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar</ul>
    <ul>1/4 granulated sugar</ul>
    <ul>1 large egg and 1 egg yolk (room temperature)</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon plain greek yogurt</ul>
    <ul>3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</ul>
    <ul>3/4 cup milk chocolate chips (or dark, white, whatever you like!)</ul>
    <ul>coarse sea salt (for sprinkling on top)</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Browning the Butter</h3>
    <ol>Add butter to a large saucepan and place over medium heat.</ol>
    <ol>The butter will begin to crackle, and then eventually foam. Make sure you whisk constantly during this process.</ol>
    <ol>After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan.</ol>
    <ol>Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma.</ol>
    <ol>Immediately transfer the butter to a medium bowl to prevent burning.</ol>
    <ol>Set aside to cool for 10 minutes or until cool enough to touch.</ol>
    <h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>With an electric mixer, mix the brown butter and sugars until well combined, about 1 minute.</ol>
    <ol>Beat in the egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and yogurt until combined.</ol>
    <h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</ol>
    <h3>Put It All Together!</h3>
    <ol>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low-speed just until combined.</ol>
    <ol>Add both chocolate chips and mix on low speed until just incorporated into the dough.</ol>
    <ol>Chill your dough for 2 hours in the refrigerator, or up to 12-24 hours. Do not try to speed up this process. The dough needs to chill in order to be perfect.</ol>
    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</ol>
    <ol>Measure 2 heaping tablespoons of the dough or use a medium cookie scoop.</ol>
    <ol>Place dough balls on cookie sheet, 2 inches apart.</ol>
    <ol>Bake the cookies 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown. They will look a bit underdone in the middle.</ol>
    <ol>Cool the cookies on the sheets for 5 minutes to allow them to set up, then sprinkle each cookie with sea salt.</ol>
    <ol>Remove the cooled cookies from the baking sheets and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</ol>
