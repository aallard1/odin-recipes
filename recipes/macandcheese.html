    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons all purpose baking flour</ul>
    <ul>1 cup whole milk</ul>
    <ul>2 cups shredded cheese (whatever cheese you like, though I'd avoid mozzarella as it doesn't blend well)</ul>
    <ul>salt and pepper to taste (the world is your oyster! add whatever spices you like!)</ul>
    <ul>1/2 box macaroni noodles</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Rue</h3>
    <ol>Add butter to small pot, melt over low heat.</ol>
    <ol>Add flour and stir to combine. Turn up heat to medium-low and stir for 2-4 minutes or until mixture smells slightly nutty.</ol>
    <ol>Add milk slowly, then reduce heat to low. Stir occasionally until rue has thickened slightly.</ol>
    <ol>Add cheese and stir to combine. Heat may be increased to aid in melting the cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Season to taste, then set aside. Stir occasionally to keep sauce homogeneous.</ol>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <ol>Boil slightly salted water in a large pot.</ol>
    <ol>When ready, add pasta. Cook as directed.</ol>
    <ol>Drain pasta in colender. Then, rinse with cold water to prevent further cooking.</ol>
    <h3>Put It All Together!</h3>
    <ol>Add pasta to sauce. Stir over medium-low heat.</ol>
    <ol>It's ready to eat!</ol>
