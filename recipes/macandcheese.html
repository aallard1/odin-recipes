    <p>This is my recipe for delicious Mac and Cheese. You can use any cheese you like, though I prefer a half and half mix of young and aged gouda. My recipe is based off of one from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mac-Cheese-Cookbook-Homeroom-Restaurant/dp/160774466X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=mac+and+cheese+cookbook&qid=1638833060&sr=8-3" target="_blank">this cookbook</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all purpose baking flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheese (whatever cheese you like, though I'd avoid mozzarella as it doesn't blend well)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste (the world is your oyster! add whatever spices you like!)</li>
            <li>1/2 box macaroni noodles</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Rue</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add butter to small pot, melt over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour and stir to combine. Turn up heat to medium-low and stir for 2-4 minutes or until mixture smells slightly nutty.</li>
            <li>Add milk slowly, then reduce heat to low. Stir occasionally until rue has thickened slightly.</li>
            <li>Add cheese and stir to combine. Heat may be increased to aid in melting the cheese.</li>
            <li>Season to taste, then set aside. Stir occasionally to keep sauce homogeneous.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil slightly salted water in a large pot.</li>
            <li>When ready, add pasta. Cook as directed.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta in colender. Then, rinse with cold water to prevent further cooking.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Put It All Together!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add pasta to sauce. Stir over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>It's ready to eat!</li>
            <li>If desired, bake in oven safe casserole dish for 15 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        </ol>
